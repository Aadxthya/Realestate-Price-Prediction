Streamlit

For creating an interactive web application to display and interact with data.
Allows user input for location, square feet, bathrooms, and bedrooms to predict prices.
Pandas

For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Used for tasks such as cleaning data, handling missing values, feature engineering, and analyzing data.
NumPy

For numerical operations, such as handling arrays and applying mathematical functions.
Used to process numerical features like square feet and prices.
Matplotlib

For creating basic visualizations and plots (e.g., histograms and scatter plots).
Helps in understanding data distribution and relationships during preprocessing.
Plotly Express

For advanced, interactive visualizations integrated into the Streamlit app.
Used to display plots such as bar charts, line plots, and scatter plots for comparing locations and price predictions.
Scikit-learn

For building and training the machine learning model (Linear Regression in this case).
Also used for splitting the data into training and testing datasets.
Pickle

To serialize and save the trained model for reuse without retraining

Analysed, preprocessed, cleaned and predicted the price for different housing in Bengaluru city using machine learning based on different features such as bhk, location, square feet etc. The project includes an interactive webpage built using streamlit.
