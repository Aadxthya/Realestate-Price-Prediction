# Realestate-Price-Prediction

This project is a real estate price prediction tool for properties in Bangalore. It uses machine learning to estimate property prices based on features like location, square footage, number of bathrooms, and number of bedrooms. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and an interactive web interface for users to input property details and visualize price predictions.

## Features

- **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, non-numeric data, and outliers. Feature engineering to create new relevant columns.
- **Model Training**: Training a Linear Regression model to predict property prices.
- **Price Prediction**: Function to predict property prices based on user input.
- **User Interaction**: Streamlit-based web interface for users to input property details and compare prices across different locations.
- **Visualization**: Plotly charts for visualizing the number of bedrooms and average price per square foot by location.
